# DonationApp
PortfolioLab

The concept of this project is easy: 
  This App crates a platform where you can give away the things you don't need anymore but might be useful to someone else.
  It allows you to donate in your own terms: you choose what, how much, to whom, when and how.
  And a pick up team will come and take it from you. EASY.
  

The idea, UX and UI research for this project was offered by CodersLab for the Portfolio Lab course.
Working on this project I've been able to exercise Django and JavaScript.
